# TrieTreeDictionary

This is a GitHub repository for a dictionary implementation that uses a trie data structure. A trie is a tree-like structure that stores words and their meanings in a compact and efficient way. With this, you can:

- Add a new word and its meaning to the dictionary
- Search for the meaning of an existing word in the dictionary
- Delete a word and its meaning from the dictionary
- Update the meaning of a word in the dictionary
- Get suggestions for words that start with a given prefix
